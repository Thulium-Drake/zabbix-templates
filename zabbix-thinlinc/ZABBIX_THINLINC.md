# NAME

zabbix_thinlinc - retrieve thinlinc license usage information for zabbix.

# SYNOPSIS

`zabbix_thinlinc [option]`

# DESCRIPTION

This command supports the use of the included template in zabbix.

# INSTALLATION

In order for the command to be useful to zabbix, a number of installation steps
need to be done.

## AGENT CONFIGURATION

### ZABBIX_THINLINC INSTALLATION

The command need to be installed on one or more zabbix agents. The default location
referenced in all files in this repository is:

`/usr/local/bin/zabbix_thinlinc`

In order for this command to work, the following software needs to be available:

* sed

### ZABBIX_THINLINC CONFIGURATION

There is one configuration file for this command

#### THINLINC CONFIGURATION

The script requires the output of `tl-show-licenses` as well as the last
line of 'var/log/thinlinc-user-licences' for processing.

The configuration file is located at:

`/etc/zabbix/zabbix-thinlinc.conf`

The file contains two variables named TLLIC and TLUSED which will specify how
the required data can be obtained.

In the sample file in this repository are a some examples for a few situations.

#### RUNNING

It is best to run the command from cron. The user running the command needs enough
privileges to run the tl-show-licenses command as well as read
/var/log/thinlinc-user-licences.

In order to create statistics the command need to be run with the getdata option:

`/usr/local/bin/zabbix_thinlinc getdata`

The output of the command will be stored in:

`/tmp/zabbix-thinlinc`

A useful crontab entry would be:

`* * * * * /usr/local/bin/zabbix_thinlinc getdata`

### CONFIGURING ZABBIX AGENT

Now that the information is being gathered, the zabbix agent needs to be made aware
of how the information can be retrieved. A configuration file is available in the
repository and should be installed at:

`/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/zabbix_agent-thinlinc.conf`

After the configuration has been added, reload the agent

`systemctl restart zabbix-agent`

## SERVER CONFIGURATION

The final step should be taken server side. In order to monitor the data a new
template needs to be imported.

* Open the zabbix webinterface
* Go to Configuration -> Templates
* Choose Import
* Choose browse and select the `template-thinlinc.xml` file in the file browser.
* Make any require changes to rules
* Select Import

The template is now available. In order to configure it for a host with a zabbix
agent that has been configuratie with the command follow the steps below.

* Open the zabbix webinterface
* Go to Configuration -> Hosts
* Select the name of the host to configure
* Go to templates
* Choose Template App Thinlinc at the Link new templates box
* Choose Add
* Choose Update

Zabbix should now start collecting data.
