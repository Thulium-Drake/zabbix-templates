# SYNOPSIS

# DESCRIPTION

This command support the use of the included template in zabbix.

# INSTALLATION

In order for the command to be useful to zabbix, a number of installation steps
need to be done.

## AGENT CONFIGURATION

### ZABBIX_NVDIA_MEM INSTALLATION

The command needs to be installed on one or more zabbix agents. The default location
referenced in all files in this repository is:

`/usr/local/bin/zabbix_nvidia_mem`

In order for this command to work, the following software needs to be available:

* jo
* nvidia-smi
* sed

### ZABBIX_NVDIA_MEM CONFIGURATION

There is no configuration required for this command. The command will detect which
gpus are available with nvidia-smi and gather statistics for all of them

#### RUNNING

It is best to run the command from cron.

In order to create statistics the command needs to be run with the getdata option:

`/usr/local/bin/zabbix_nvidia_mem getdata`

The output data of the command will be stored in:

`/tmp/zabbix-nvidia-mem`

A useful crontab entry would be:

`* * * * * /usr/local/bin/zabbix_nvidia_mem getdata`

### CONFIGURING ZABBIX AGENT

Now that the information is being gathered, the zabbix agent needs to be made aware
of how the information can be retrieved. A configuration file is available in the
repository and should be installed at:

`/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/zabbix_agent-nvidia-mem.conf`

After the configuration has been added, reload the agent

`systemctl restart zabbix-agent`

## SERVER CONFIGURATION

The final step should be taken server side. In order to monitor the data a new
template needs to be imported.

* Open the zabbix webinterface
* Go to Configuration -> Templates
* Choose Import
* Choose browse and select the `template-nvidia-mem.xml` file in the file browser.
* Make any require changes to rules
* Select Import

The template is now available. In order to configure it for a host with a zabbix
agent that has been configuratie with the command follow the steps below.

* Open the zabbix webinterface
* Go to Configuration -> Hosts
* Select the name of the host to configure
* Go to templates
* Choose Template Nvidia Memory at the Link new templates box
* Choose Add

Zabbix should now start collecting data.
