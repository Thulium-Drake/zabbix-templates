### ZABBIX_NETSTAT CONFIGURATION

There is no configuration required for this command. The command will detect which
interfaces are available by reading /proc/net/dev.

#### RUNNING

It is best to run the command from cron. The user running the command needs enough
privileges to read /proc/net/dev.

of how the information can be retrieved. A configuration file is available in the
repository and should be installed at:

`/etc/zabbix/zabbix_agentd.d/zabbix_agent-netstat.conf`

After the configuration has been added, reload the agent

`systemctl restart zabbix-agent`

template needs to be imported.

* Go to Configuration -> Templates
* Choose Import
* Choose browse and select the `template-netstat.xml` file in the file browser.
* Make any require changes to rules
